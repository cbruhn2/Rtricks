## Hvordan man downloader data fra en url

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Chicago}
download.file("http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/leanpub/rprog/chicago_data.zip","ChicagoData.zip")
unzip("ChicagoData.zip")
chicago<-readRDS("chicago.rds")
names(chicago)
summary(chicago)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")        
plot(chicago$date,chicago$tmpd)
qplot(date, tmpd, data = chicago, geom = c("line", "point"))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
